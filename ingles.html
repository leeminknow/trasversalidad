    <h2>ECOLOGICAL HOUSE</h2>
    <p>It is the one that achieves the optimal<br>conditions of habitability with the minimum<br>minimum energy consumption, taking into<br>taking into account the orientation of the <br>construction the terrain and the<br>nature. Below you will find information<br>on the subject and the process we<br>we did to build an ecological house.<br>We also implemented<br>pages of other subjects.</p>
    <p>This project is important for<br>raise awareness that ecology<br>helps us to save from 3% to<br>90% minimizes the environmental<br>impact on the cost of maintenance <br>and contribute to health.<br>The materials are mostly recyclable.</p>
    <p>The effect of overpopulation is the unequal and<br>disproportionate consumption of resources.<br>The planet has a limited capacity to generate<br>generation of raw materials, and every year<br>the deficit of natural resources, the<br>consumption at a faster rate than the planet can<br>generate them, arrives faster.<br>Ecological houses make the best use of<br>natural resources as well as possible,<br>because they use energy from the sun, air<br>and reuse water. In this way, renewable energies<br>such as geothermal, acrothermal<br> and solar photovoltaics are generated.</p>

  <h4>INFORMATION</h4>
  <p>The disproportionate population increase<br>also generates social and economic<br>problems, as it exceeds<br>the carrying capacity of natural<br>natural resources, as well as<br>the competence of governments to<br>to provide employment<br>employment, housing, public services,<br>services health and education.</p>
  <p> To meet the needs with these resources or  to<br>to build other structures,<br>deforestation and logging<br>is one of the consequences of <br>overpopulation, which not only<br>affects forests or natural ecosystems,<br>but also affects<br>biodiversity and all that makes it up.</p>
  <p>A well-planned project of ecological houses<br>in Tijuana as well as other communities,<br>benefits mainly in the cost and<br>expenses of maintenance and<br>construction. The objective of the<br>ecological houses is to satisfy the<br>needs of people living in an environmentally<br>in an environmentally friendly way.<br>In Tijuana,  air pollution is excessive and<br>noticeable, by using greenhouse gas<br>by the business industry<br>emissions is reduced by 13%.</p>
  <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
  <p>We have to take into account what is happening on our planet and how it is affecting us.<br> Not only for the impact it has had on the present, but also on the impact it will have<br>on future generations. In carrying out this project we had some complications,<br>including the organization of the team, but in the end we managed to divide the work.<br>We also learned that we must use renewable energies.</p>
